    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>STEP 1</h3>
    <p>First of all, make the coffee. For a quick and delicious Italian coffee, we used an Espresso Machine. Then add 2 tablespoons of Rum or Marsala wine.</p>
    <h3>STEP 2</h3>
    <p>Separate the egg whites from the yolks. Set aside the yolks and whip the egg whites until stiff: you will get at it when the the egg whites will not move if you turn the bowl over.</p>
    <h3>STEP 3</h3>
    <p>Now, in a bowl, beat the egg yolks with sugar until light and smooth, 3 to 5 minutes.</h2>
    <h3>STEP 4</h3>
    <p>In the meantime, pour the mascarpone cheese into a bowl and work it with a spoon to make it softer. Mascarpone cheese must be of excellent quality, creamy and thick. 
        When the yolks are ready add the mascarpone cheese.</p>
    <h3>STEP 5</h3>
    <p>Using the flexible-edge k-beater, slowly whip the mascarpone cream for 2 to 3 minutes. Now add the stiffly beaten egg whites.</p>
    <h3>STEP 6</h3>
    <p>Mix with a wooden spoon, from bottom up. Mix slowly until smooth and creamy.</p>
    <h3>STEP 7</h3>
    <p>Now let’s prepare the layers of ladyfingers and mascarpone cream. You can make 2 or more layers, depending on the width and depth of your pan.</p>
    <p>Dip the ladyfingers quickly (1 or 2 seconds) into the coffee. Then arrange the ladyfingers in the casserole of your liking.</p> 
    <p><strong>IMPORTANT.</strong>The ladyfingers should not soak too much coffee, otherwise the tiramisu will be too rich in coffee and runny.</p>
    <h3>STEP 8</h3>
    <p>Arrange them so that they cover the bottom of the casserole. Then spread the mascarpone cream over the ladyfingers.</p>
    <h3>STEP 9</h3>
    <p>Add another layer of ladyfingers and then top with more mascarpone cream. If you are making the last layer, spread the mascarpone cream generously.</p>
    <h3>STEP 10</h3>
    <p>Finally, sprinkle with cocoa powder. You can even add dark chocolate chips, if you like.</p>
    <p>Allow to rest 3 hours in the refrigerator before serving. Even better if you prepare the tiramisu the day before, letting it rest overnight.</p>
